## Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)

  

The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an **open-source, REST API-based protocol** developed by IBM to facilitate **interoperability** between:

* **AI agents**

* **AI applications**

* **Humans**

  

Modern AI agents are often built in isolation, utilizing diverse frameworks, teams, and infrastructures. ACP addresses this by enabling **seamless collaboration**: agents communicate through a **standardized RESTful API**, making them agnostic to their internal implementations.

  

### Key Benefits

  

ACP  solves  the  "MxN  problem"  where  agents,  AI,  and  multi-cloud  platform  (MCP)  tools  are  developed  in  different  systems,  each  with  its  own  patterns.  Traditional  point-to-point  integrations  don't  scale  effectively,  but  **RESTful  systems  do**,  offering  a  solution  to  scalability  challenges.

  

#### Why Choose ACP?

  

*  **Flexible  Agent  Replacement**:  If  an  underlying  agent  changes,  the  REST  API  endpoint  remains  unaffected,  ensuring  system  stability.

*  **Multi-Agent  Collaboration**:  Build  sophisticated  systems  where  specialized  agents  can  work  together  as  coordinated  teams.

*  **Cross-Platform  Integration**:  Connect  agents  across  your  entire  technology  stack.

  

ACP  is  designed  to  be  **async-first,  with  sync  support**,  primarily  built  for  asynchronous  communication  to  effectively  handle  long-running  agent  tasks.
